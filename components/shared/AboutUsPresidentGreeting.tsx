        <p className="">
          Hiro Career Staff Co., Ltd. was established in 1996 and began its
          specialized professional services in the medical and caregiving fields
          in 2006. As of 2022, we have celebrated our 16th year. Initially, our
          operations were limited to the three Tohoku prefectures including
          Iwate, but in response to societal needs, we have expanded our
          coverage area to include the entire Tohoku region, extending from
          Hokkaido in the north to Nagano Prefecture in the south.
        </p>
        <p className="">
          In 2025, to address the significant shortage of approximately 430,000
          personnel in the medical and caregiving industries, Hiro Career Staff
          will propose new ways of working and new career plans for medical and
          caregiving professionals. Our mission is to provide services that
          satisfy both our client companies and job seekers in the medical and
          caregiving professions. As evidence of this commitment, we regard
          "Customer First" (C1) as the core of our company's operations, which
          is shared by all employees.
